Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance said Tuesday it received regulatory clearance to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores — 254 fewer stores than it had previously intended.

The approved deal is for $4.38 billion.

A previous agreement where Walgreens agreed to buy Rite Aid and nearly 4,600 of its stores for $9.4 billion was scotched by federal regulators in June over antitrust fears that the combined entity — which would become the No. 1 drugstore chain in the country — would wield too much power over pharmacy benefit managers.

In the approved deal, Rite Aid has been offered the option of joining Walgreens’ group purchasing agreement to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.

Walgreens also said it would buy Rite Aid’s three distribution centers located in Dayville, Conn.; Philadelphia; and Spartanburg, SC.

The No. 1 US drugstore chain had said in July it would buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores for $5.18 billion after it failed to win approval from the Federal Trade Commission to take over the nearly 4,600-store chain.

Walgreens said it does not expect the deal to have a significant impact on its adjusted earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018.

Store purchases would begin in October, with completion anticipated in spring 2018.

Deerfield, Ill., Walgreens said it expects to realize annual synergies from the new transaction of about $300 million.

Shares of Walgreens were down 1.9 percent in early Tuesday trading, to $81.07, while Rite Aid’s shares were down 9.2 percent, to $2.48.
