Web giant Amazon (AMZN) could be prepping to move into the multibillion-dollar prescription drug market just two months after digging deeper into the grocery market with its acquisition of Whole Foods.

The company will make a decision before Thanksgiving, according to an email and an inside source cited by CNBC on Friday. If Amazon moves into selling prescription drugs online, it will work to bulk up its senior team with drug supply chain experts.

By the closing bell on the stock market today, Amazon gained 0.9% to close at 989.58. It's first in terms of market cap in IBD's 34-company Retail-Internet group. Tacking on prescription drug sales could give it a major edge.

This is not the first time Amazon has been rumored to be considering a move into the online prescription drug market, an area currently dominated by the likes of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS). Health care spending is a lucrative market with growth seen averaging 5.8% from 2014-24.

In May, Morgan Stanley estimated $106 billion of the $465 billion U.S. pharma business was done through mail-order prescriptions. Amazon's revenue would rise by 20% if it could get a share of the market, according to the analyst.


Earlier this year, Amazon brought on Mark Lyons, a former Premera Blue Cross veteran, to create a pharmacy benefits team. Insiders say it's possible this could pre-empt Amazon's push into the wider prescription drug market.

Amazon declined to comment in an email to Investor's Business Daily.

CVS stock fell 4.9% to close at 76.92, while Walgreens dropped 4.9% to finish at 73.20.
